The user has two separate Claude/Codex accounts (work and private), configured with different config directories so both logins work independently, e.g. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/user/.confuig/claude/accounts/private/`. Sometimes they end up on the "wrong" one for a given terminal/session.

**Why:** Discovered 2026-08-18 while testing whether memory management was "broken" — the `record-memory` hook (`scripts/°base/ai/hooks/record-memory/hook.py`) hardcoded `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/memory/` as the memory source dir, so it silently never saw memory files written under a relocated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Fixed in commit `b402a60` by adding `_claude_config_dir()`, mirroring the pattern `save-plan/hook.py` already used (see `_is_plan_file_path` there, which reads `os.environ.get("CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR")`).

**How to apply:** Any base-repo hook or script that locates per-project Claude state under `~/.claude/...` (plans, memory, sessions, etc.) needs to check `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` first and fall back to `~/.claude`, or it will silently misbehave for this user under one of the two accounts. Known still-unfixed instance: `scripts/°base/ai/memory/delete.py`'s own `_encoded_project_dir()` duplicates the old hardcoded-`~/.claude` logic instead of reusing the fixed hook's helper — the official memory-delete CLI will fail to find memories saved under a relocated config dir. See [[project-codex-memory-orphan-resource-bug]] for a separate, unrelated sync issue found in the same session.
